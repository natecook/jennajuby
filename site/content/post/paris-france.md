The summer of 2022 we took Dean on his first trip to Paris! We only spent a short time there before heading off to Spain but as always...Paris delivered. We were a little nervous the city of lights wouldn't be quite as "light" with a 2 year old in tow but somehow it was. Paris is similar to New York in a lot of ways, which made our time there so easy and relaxing. Dean has only ever known life in a city and we explored Paris with him as easy as we live our day to day in New York. We started everyday stopping for a pastry and some coffee first and then head straight to the garden, park, or playground of the day. On this trip we also brought our babysitter so we got to go out while Dean napped at the airbnb in the afternoons and in the evenings when he went to bed. It was great to have help with us when Dean was this age because he slept so much and instead of being stuck inside we got to take that time to explore the city just the two of us. It was a wonderful three days and just writing this I am dying to go back! We stayed in the 7th arrondissement so a lot of my recommendations are in this area and the 6th right next to it. This is definitely not a comprehensive list of where to eat or what to do in Paris but they are the places we enjoyed on our short trip there this time!

**Activities** 

\- [Luxembourg Gardens](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9x6BRUKptKbwfvAz8), we spent a lot of time there when we had Dean with us because we stayed near by. They have a playground, carousel, pony riding, mini boat sailing, ice cream, a cafe for lunch...basically a family's dream spot! Apart from those things it's just a beautiful spot to walk around and admire all the gardens. There's lot of places to sit and relax and take in the gorgeous surroundings. 

\- [Tuileries Gardens](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kVomiihDEGRwqdhd8), another great spot for adults and kiddos alike...lots of room to run, a carousel, playground, mini trampolines, lots of spots to stop for coffee or ice cream, and in the summers a small amusement rides for kids. The gardens lay in the shadow of the Louvre and the backdrop of the museum with the flowers and walkways in front of it are stunning. 

\- [Trocadero Gardens](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mzaDpXiJN53G1P8e9), this place is more touristy but it has an awesome view of the Eiffel tower and the city behind it. It's defintely worth seeing if you haven't yet!

\- [Palais Royal Garden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zexvRkzu6hfUMTbR6), another adorable garden to explore, stop to see the art, flowers, fountaines and grab a coffee or afternoon spritz at one of the cafes looking onto the gardens.
