Anyone who knows me knows that Paris is one of my favorite places in the entire world and I will jump at any opportunity to go! This spring, our friends Kate and Sam, needed to renew their visa (they're Australian), and decided to do it in Paris, and Nate and I, plus Haley and Ryan, joined them! Our little crew explored the city for the first couple days together. And then Nate and I met up with our friends Kayleigh and Josh, who happened to be in Paris at the same time! It was really fun getting to explore a city I love with friends, and it made the experience that much sweeter. The last few days of the trip (we were only there a week), was just Nate and I, and we took a day trip to Versailles. Our week was full of a lot of food, and a lot of exploring. I loved every minute of it and can't wait to go back to Paris again, because we all know I can't stay away. Also, I beat my record of croissants (last time I had 17 in 5 days) and this trip I had 22 in 7 days. NOOOOT bad. Here are the places I recommend to eat/drink/be merry, things to do, and where to stay! Of course that's followed by a hundred or so of my favorite photos from the trip. Also, here's a link to one of the posts I wrote about Paris last time we went, with a list of [tips and tricks](http://jennajuby.com/2017/05/09/paris-part-1/) on traveling there! **Where To Stay** This is the question I get asked most about traveling to Paris. It's a big city and every arrondissement is so different, it's hard to pick. My recommendation is to stay in an airbnb (we did this and loved it). We also spent the second half of our week in a hotel, which was nice to be pampered a little bit too. Here is my list of preferred districts to stay, in order of preference, including my preferred neighborhood within that district. **6**: St. Germain- This is my favorite district, and I think the prettiest. It's full of gardens, beautiful cafes, high end shops, and clean sidewalks. I love it. **7**: Invalides: This is like St. Germains more quiet younger brother. It's clean and quiet, but weirdly close to all the action for being so chill. Right next to the Eiffel Tower and easy train stations but low key and pretty. **3/4**: Le Marais- This is where all the fun restaurants and shops are, in the middle of all the action, but also far enough away from really touristy stuff that it feels more local. This neighborhood definitely has the best places to eat, but is also easy to get to from 6. **1/2**: Anywhere in here will be mostly quiet and classy, there are a lot of high hiiiigh end shops, but not much night life. This is a very clean district and is close to the Tuileries gardens and the Louvre. We stayed in 2 the first time we visited Paris and it was pretty convenient and pleasant! **Eats & Treats** Coffee: [Honor](https://www.instagram.com/honorcafe/), [Ob-La-Di Cafe](https://www.instagram.com/obladicafe/?hl=en), [Cuillier](https://www.instagram.com/cuillierparis/?hl=en), [Coutume](https://www.instagram.com/coutumecafe/?hl=en) Bakery: [La Guinguette dâ€™angele](https://www.instagram.com/laguinguettedangele/?hl=en) Croissant: [Le Grenier a Pain](http://legrenierapain.com/) and [Tout Autour du Pain](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tout-Autour-du-Pain/927695087302384) Macaron: [Pierre Herme](https://www.instagram.com/pierreherme/?hl=en) and [Laduree](https://www.instagram.com/maisonladuree/?hl=en) Breakfast: [Marcelle](https://www.instagram.com/restaurant_marcelle/?hl=en) and [Passager](https://www.instagram.com/passager_cafe/?hl=en) Brunch: [Cafe De Flore](http://cafedeflore.fr/) Crepe: [Brutus](https://www.instagram.com/brutus_paris/) and [La Creperie de Josselin](https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Cr%C3%AAperie+de+Josselin/@48.841703,2.3232243,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47e671cc0a8a9235:0xf280f216bb7c8d28!8m2!3d48.841703!4d2.325413) Lunch: [Pink Mamma](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/pinkmamma/), picnic on the Seine Afternoon wine: [La Maison Rose](https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/125124958207068/la-maison-rose/), [Hotel De Crillon](https://www.instagram.com/rwcrillon/) courtyard, [Hotel Grand Amour](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/hotelgrandamour/) courtyard Dinner: [Ferdi](https://www.instagram.com/ferdirestaurant/), [Carbon](https://www.instagram.com/carbon_paris/), [Les Philosophes](https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/340222/les-philosophes/), [Poulette](https://www.instagram.com/pouletterestaurant/), [Les Ombres](https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/217214915/les-ombres/) Dessert: [Scoop Me A Cookie](https://www.instagram.com/scoopmeacookie/), street cart crepe, any cute outdoor cafe with a dessert menu!

Go early, right when it opens, and plan on spending more of your day in the gardens than in the house. Plan on most of the day here and get lunch at the cafe, grab some ice cream, and rent a row boat too! It's all so beautiful! - Head to Le Palais Royal early in the morning before the courtyard is too crowded...and make sure to walk around the beautiful garden there too and see all the shops and cafes along the palais. - Explore the non touristy parts of Montmartre, away from the crowds it is the most beautiful little neighborhood with charming old homes including Van Goghs! - See the Musee National Gustave Moreau, a smaller less intimidating way to see Parisian paintings - Ride a carousel in the Tuileries - Run or take a walk in the early mornings, I love seeing cities this way, the sun rising and people just waking up, it's a great way to see a city - Spend every morning with an espresso and croissant and every evening with a glass of wine and dessert, at a cafe, people watching. There is nothing better than this. \[su\_row\] \[su\_column size="1/2"\] ![](http://jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Paris_Blog-1.jpg)\[/su\_column\] \[su\_column size="1/2"\]
