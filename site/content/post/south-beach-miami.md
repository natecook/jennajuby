This past winter, Nate and I wanted to go on another warm weather escape and chose Miami Florida. It's a running joke that Miami is New York's 6th borough because so many of us vacation there in the winter. In actuality, we went to South Beach, which is very different from downtown Miami, but it's definitely where you go for the beach get-away you've been picturing. And being NYC's 6th borough, it, of course, has a loooot of amazing food and even a few sister restaurants to some favorites in Manhattan. Here is my complete list of the best places to chow down in South Beach!

A long weekend in Miami is exactly what our pale frozen bodies needed this February. And winter is the best time to visit South Beach because it's not humid- hurray! While we were there we did a [sunrise yoga](http://3rdstreetbeachyoga.com/3rdStreeBeachYoga.com/Home.html) class which was one of our very favorite things we did on the trip, the empty peaceful beach at sunrise was a perfect start to the day. Another fun thing we did over the weekend was rent vespas and cruise around South Beach to see all the art deco buildings. The architecture in Miami and is really bright and crazy and it's not a trip to South Beach if you don't get a photo of some neon pink building.

Most of the other time we spent laying by the pool and playing in the ocean- the water was really warm and clear! We also explored the Westwood neighborhood which boasts good coffee, foodtrucks, and bars. Definitely worth going downtown to explore this area and see all the crazy murals it's famous for! Also, I would just like to point out that everyone thinks they are going to go to Miami and get zika and die. I am here to say I went twice in the past year and didn't even get one bug bit. So there's that. Lastly, I know I already listed restaurants above but it would be wrong not to mention again that the weekend brunch buffet at Cecconi's was one of our best memories from the trip. It's only served Sat + Sun and aside from the food being to die for, the patio outside was stunning, and we even saw some celebs dining with us which was fun. If you spend no other money on food in Miami, go to this brunch. Please. And then mail me a croissant.
