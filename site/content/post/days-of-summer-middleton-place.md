Since today is the last day of summer (sobs), I thought it appropriate to post some photos of one of my very favorite summer evenings. When my family was in Charleston, we took a "wine stroll" through [Middleton Place](https://www.middletonplace.org/ "Middleton Place"). Middleton Place is a historical home and also known for being our countries oldest landscaped gardens. It's truly a stunning place and was hard not to have my camera out the entire time. I've never been on a "wine stroll" before but....I now consider them one of my favorite hobbies. Can you consider something a hobby if you've only done it once? Anyway, you basically just...stroll (I sincerely couldn't think of another word) around the gardens and there are 5-6 different "stations", if you will, that serve two types of wine you can pick from. My mom and I even got into the sangria line like 3 times and they didn't even yell at us! So kind. Oh! And we saw an alligator, which Nicholas, of course, was the only one of 100+ people there to entice it to the edge of the pond by throwing it fruit from my sangria. Cool. I'm reeaaally fond of large wild animals. Ask any of my friends. SOMEHOW we survived and made it to the rest of the wine stations. PTL. Well, goodbye summer, I hope you're as magical next year as you were this year. xo ![Travel photography, LA photography,
