Even though New York gets a bad rep for it’s winter weather, it’s still such a fun city to visit no matter what month you come! And to be honest, the winter’s here are not that bad. We’ll get a cold spell for a week or so, we may get one or two snow storms (if we’re lucky), but most of the time you can plan on it being 38 degrees and partly sunny most of winter. It’s nothing to write home about but it’s far from being miserable. Plus, there are so many awesome indoor activities that it makes the winter that much more bearable! Last winter we hibernated for most of January and February and then took a trip to the beach to warm up. But this year (for the first time) we weren’t going on any weekend beach trips through the cold months. SO, I decided to double down on all the fun winter activities we could do since we were staying in town. There are a lot of fun things to see indoors that I wouldn’t usually during the 3 other seasons because I want to take advantage of being outside. So this was the perfect excuse to check them all of my new york to do list! Here is my list of the best winter (non Christmas related) activities to do inside and coziest winter restaurants. 

**Things To Do**

* The Metropolitan Museum Of Art, this is one of my favorite places in the city regardless of season. It’s one of the most amazing museums in the world!
* See a Broadway show, I have loved so many...but some of my favorites were Beautiful, Hello Dolly, Waitress, Lion King, and Pretty Woman
* One World Observatory at the World Trade Center
* Grand Central Station, the ceiling here is mesmerizing. But explore more than the main atrium; there’s a whole food court there including Cafe Grumpy (some of nyc’s best coffee), Magnolia Bakery, and some of the most famous oysters in the city at Grand Central Oyster Bar.
* 9/11 Museum. The memorial is free to the public outside and good to visit in all seasons, but the museum is vast and you’ll want to spend at least a few hours there (I would allow yourself 3 at least, it’s an unforgettable experience). 
* Go inside St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Cathedral of St. John The Divine, and/or The Riverside Church to see gothic style grand cathedrals
* Go to a jazz show (I will list my favorites places below)
* Bowling at Brooklyn Bowl, you can do a bowling brunch here on Saturday mornings or a concert/bowling experience on weekend nights
* The Whitney Museum and MOMA, both showcase more modern art, both are incredible. The Whitney does boast a cool observation deck if you can’t decide between the two!
* Movie at iPic, this is the world’s fanciest movie there, order champagne (or ice cream sundae or pizza or burger) from your totally private lounge chairs 
* Morgan Library and Museum, is such a fascinating place and much like the Frick (both used to be personal residences that were turned into museums) it feels like you’re in the best kept secret of the city. 
* Opera at Lincoln Center, this is incredibly epic and I have not done it yet but it’s on my bucket list! 
* Museum of Natural History
* Comedy Cellar, this is one of the most famous comedy houses in the world, and you should plan on getting reservations weeks ahead of time!
* The Frick Collection, one of my favorite places in the city!
* Get high tea at the Plaza Hotel, this speaks for itself I think.
* Shop in Soho, although exploring the shops in this area isn’t totally inside, it’s a great time of year to shop!
