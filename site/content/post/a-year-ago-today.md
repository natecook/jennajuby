i had Ben Lee ready on spotify and cuddled into my bed, ready to take on the blog world....then the internet went out. it's funny how it feels like your productivity has to come to a complete stop when either 1. you have no wifi. 2. you have no music. don't hold your breath too long though. it's back on! since I live in soCal these days i often think about what my life looked like a year ago, because it looked...well...so different. let's take a trip down memory lane via some fun photos. my cousin/friend/loveofmylife Bree and I started training for our first half marathon together a year ago this month! this picture kills me because it brings back hilarious memories. me: "Bree, now that we've run together (we ran 1.5 miles), would you maybe wanna run a half with me?" b: "yeah sure, what is that, like 6 miles?" me: "errr 13....13.1" fast forward a week. both of us are either about to puke or stop oxygen flow all together.

(i think i'll be typing that a lot through this post)

Moving on. MARCH. i fly to here (orange county) to visit my dear friend and now roommate chelsea kim for her 25th birthday. i also visited the school i was hoping to go to (UCLA) and oh yeah, fell in love. pictured here- [![IMG_7217](http://jennajuby.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_7217.jpg?w=200)](http://jennajuby.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_7217.jpg) pretty cool right? i actually have a picture of myself falling in love. ok realistically i was falling into infatuation. infatuation with the sweetest man with the dreamiest head of hair. so yeah. loved the school. loved spending time with one of my best friends (seen below in cute scarf). loved my new church, new ocean. and that's when i knew i was going to move out here. pretty epic trip all in all.
