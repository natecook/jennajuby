The second place we went on our tour of Italy was the Amalfi Coast! We stayed in Sorrento and took day trips out to Capri and Positano from there. We were in the area for 3 days and ended up spending 2 of the days in Positano. The Amalfi Coast is a little complicated to navigate if you are planning a trip there, so I’ll add some tips and tricks to navigating the area below.

Our first day there we rented a car in Sorrento and drove the 50 minutes to Positano.  The drive in is all along the coast and the views are stunning the whole time! As you’ll learn, the drive is not for the faint of heart...it’s fast, busy, winding, and I had to drive it in a manual car. I wish I had gotten some cute photos of me driving because the car was an adorable white fiat convertible but alas I was distracted keeping us alive.  So, it was an interesting experience to say the least, but worth it for the ocean views! 

Our first day in Positano we spent exploring the town, shopping, and eating our way around while sightseeing.  The second day we arrived in Positano by ferry and spent the day at a [beach club](https://goo.gl/maps/qF4wo6dAB3BBEH8k9) lounging by the ocean.  That afternoon was so dreamy and one of our favorite things we did while in Italy! And as you can see, Positano is small, so you could easily combine both of these days in one if you needed. 

The views of Positano from the water and the views of it from inside the town seem like they can’t be real, a true postcard of a place.  There are so many yummy places to eat and drink but below I listed my favorites...most of them have a view from the table, because if not, why bother!?

# Eats & Treats

Honorable mentions: [Il Fornillo](https://goo.gl/maps/x9hihbXrAcn2XoYM7), [Da Gabrisa](https://g.page/dagabrisa?share), [Cafe Positano](https://g.page/caffe-positano-positano?share) (go for the view, not the food)



# Activities

* Spend the day at [La Scogliera](https://goo.gl/maps/qF4wo6dAB3BBEH8k9) resort, you have to reserve your loungers ahead of time, it was some of the best money we spent!
* Shop around the village, there are so many artisan vendors from clothing boutiques to ceramics.
* Get a drink at [Franco’s Bar](https://goo.gl/maps/3SuvYVekKLqLJkRVA), this is an event in itself because people get VERY intense about getting there early and snagging a table with a view. I would line up 15-20 minutes before they even open to get a good stop and then take your grand old time and drink the night away!
* Eat every single meal with a view of the village and sea, there’s no reason not to in such a beautiful place
* Spend the day on a private beach at [Arienzo Beach Club](https://g.page/arienzobeachclub?share), which is only accessible by boat!
* Take one of the many boat tours available, [Blue Star](http://www.bluestarpositano.it/english.htm) is a recommended company.
* Walk down to the pier for amazing photos and walk along the beach, grabbing a drink at one of the many cafe’s and bars along the water.
* See the beautiful [“Church of Saint Mary of the Assumption”](https://goo.gl/maps/Jeh1afi35Kafp8qh7), which used to be part of a monastery.

# Tips & Tricks

* Book your accommodations in Positano. There are lots of places to stay in the Amalfi Coast area...Sorrento, Capri, Amalfi, Naples, Ravello, the list goes on. You'll find different reasons people say you should stay in each place, but if you can afford it, stay in Positano. You'll want to spend the bulk of your time here anyway, it's the most quintessential place you are picturing when you think about the Amalfi Coast, and you can take ferries or buses to all the other towns. Trust me, this will make your time here so much less hectic if you just stay in Positano. 
* The village of Positano is VERY hilly (obviously), but plan on walking up and down stairs constantly and everything taking a lot longer to get to than you anticipate. My advice is to take it slow, stop a lot to window shop or grab a drink.
* Visit in May or September when the weather is cooler and the crowds are smaller.
* Make reservations for any dinners or clubs you plan to visit. Positano is really popular and places book out far ahead of time.
* If you don't stay in Positano while visiting Amalfi Coast, I would take a ferry in to see the town for the day (again book this as far out as you can), then you can avoid the traffic whether you're in a bus, car, or scooter.
