  With a few unexpected free days in Italy before we left, we decided to make a
  day trip to Pisa and then stay a few nights in Tuscany!

Our last few days in Italy were supposed to be spent in Cinque Terre but we ended up having to cancel because of bad weather. So we decided to spend those days anywhere the sun was shining that we could get to in a days drive from Florence. The first place we found was Pisa! Only a quick train ride away from Florence and what better time to see the famous leaning tower than when we have a few days to kill? It ended up being a really fun spontaneous day of doing touristy stuff and we had a blast. The leaning tower of Pisa was actually much more fascinating to see in person than I thought. If you ever find yourself with extra time in Nothern Italy, it's worth a quick stop! The town you go through to get to the tower isn't much to see but the river and church were beautiful.

With the other extra days we had we decided to spend more time in wine country. First we stopped at [Tenuta di Capezzana](https://goo.gl/maps/Tmi53tHukzxMo93A7), a gorgeous winery with a killer view (and wine of course).  We also booked a few nights at the [Renaissance Tuscany il Ciocco Resort & Spa](https://goo.gl/maps/a7YcZe7WP9rET8PU8). This was the perfect ending to our trip.  It was a gorgeous resort, so relaxing, unreal views, and we were there at the start of October so the weather was mild, perfect for wine tasting. If we go back to Tuscany one day, we will definitely try to stay a few nights here again!
