We have always wanted to take a trip with our friends Meghan and Taylor, and this year it finally happened! Meghan and I were chatting about where we should go together and it turned out Zion National Park was on both of our lists to see! We flew in to Las Vegas and they drove in from LA and picked us up on the way to Zion. It was a 3 hour drive from Vegas to our camp in Utah, which all together made getting there from New York pretty easy considering where it is! Thank goodness for Las Vegas being in the middle of the desert, eh?

So, we stayed at [Under Canvas](https://www.instagram.com/undercanvasofficial/?hl=en) and it was incredible. It's a "glamping" camp ground which was riiiiight up my alley. I love being outdoors and in nature, I love roasting marshmallows, drinking by the fire at night, and falling asleep under the stars. But let's be honest, I'm not exactly what you would call a professional camper. Not only do we have zero equipment besides a few steel mugs (LOL), we also couldn't drive to many of the national parks that we want to visit unless we made a weeks long road trip out of it. So glamping at Under Canvas was the perfect solution and also a great combination of getting all the things you love about camping without any of the actual work that goes into it.

Under Canvas had everything you want or need, comfortable king size beds, a full bathroom with hot water in your tent, a wood burning heater, and even 24 hour help from the staff if you need it. They have a full restaurant on site that offers breakfast, lunch, dinner, aaaaand wine and beer. They provide all s'mores supplies for you every night with a ready made bon fire. This place was actual perfection. We loved the park but honestly staying at Under Canvas was the best part! It's set in the most beautiful spot with killer views, and only 25-30 minute drive into the base of the park. Also, it's worth noting that they had great gluten free and vegetarian options, and 'round the clock coffee and tea in the lobby tent. Lastly, the view from our tent was incredible (there are LOTS of pictures of it below). We spent every night relaxing with a glass of wine and watching the sunset and it was so peaceful. This goes without saying...I highly recommend staying at [Under Canvas](https://www.instagram.com/undercanvasofficial/?hl=en) if you plan on visiting Zion, haha.

The actual park itself was so so beautiful. We decided to visit in April because the weather is so mild this time of year...warm 70-80 degrees during the day and 40-50's at night. What we didn't realize was that because we were there so early in the season, the park was still really green and lush. It made all the colors pop and the entire park was just a sight to behold.

**Some of the activities we did there were...**

- Hike Observation Point Trail
- Horseback ride
- Grab lunch in town (Springdale) at Cafe Soleil after you hike
- Hike Canyon Overlook Trail
- Eat, drink, be merry, and do campy stuff

**Here are some other things you can do there...**

- Sunrise or sunset yoga at Under Canvas
- Canyoneering
- Hot air balloon ride
- Helicopter tour

**Some other hikes to consider...**

- Riverside Walk
- Hidden Canyon
- Angels Landing
- Emerald Pools

Lastly, here's a [blog](https://www.earthtrekkers.com/) that Meghan found that we referenced a lot when deciding what hikes and activities to do. It was really helpful!
