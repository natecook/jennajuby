I've always wanted to say that, "Viva La Mexico!" and actually be in Mexico. Kinda like saying "Aloha!!" in Hawaii because it's the only place you don't feel like a total poser. Last weekend, we crossed the border to Mexico, and I finally could! Having grown up in Ohio, driving to Mexico wasn't the weekend get away most people took (considering it takes 20+ hours). If you went to Mexico while living in Ohio it was either to 1. Honeymoon or 2. Build houses on a mission trip. Even though it was a meer 4 hour drive, it felt exotic to me- I mean, you have to show a passport, so that's something. On Friday we caravanned with 11 of our friends and stayed for two nights at Los Gaviotas, which is south Rosarito, Mexico. This trip was our spring retreat as a life group and we essentially ate, talked, beached, and sipped wine all weekend. Words can't say how much I love these people. I think I take for granted how quality this group of friends is because I'm so used to them being there. But time with them is so...comfortable, and easy, and insanely fun. We sit around and tell totally ridiculous stories that so many other people would shame or judge and we just laugh at each other. It's incredible to be in a group of people that big and really just be yourself and they love you anyway. Not only do they know all your crap, but they've have walked through it with you. And embrace it. Thank you, Jesus, for these people. ![ForBlog-35](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-35.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-9](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-9.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-17](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-17.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-14](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-14.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-10](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-10.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-34](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-34.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-16](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-16.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-19](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-19.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-21](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-21.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-20](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-20.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-25](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-25.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-23](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-23.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-4](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-4.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-6](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-6.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-13](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-13.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-12](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-12.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-11](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-11.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-33](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-33.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-1](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-1.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-32](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-32.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-31](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-31.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-36](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-36.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-5](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-5.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-8](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-8.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-7](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-7.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-24](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-24.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-28](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-28.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-26](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-26.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-30](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-30.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-29](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-29.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-27](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-27.jpg?w=560) ![ForBlog-2](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/forblog-2.jpg?w=560) The two photos of Nate and I (which I loooove), and the one of myself walking to the beach are thanks to [Katie](http://hopeengaged.blogspot.com/ "Katie"), my sister in law.
