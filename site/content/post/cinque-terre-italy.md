The last stop on our trip through Italy was to Cinque Terre. Initially, we had planned to spend a few days here but our itinerary changed last minute and we sadly only got one day in this gorgeous place.

There are 5 villages that make up Cinque Terre, hence the name, and we stopped at 3 of them. The first was Monterosso, the only village with an organized beach and relatively flat town. The views of the water were stunning and we had delicious food here. The second village was Vernazza, it had a lively pier area with lots of cafes shops, not to mention the town itself was absolutely beautiful. The last village we visited was Riomaggiore, set up against the coast like a storybook, this village is the quintessential Cinque Terre town you are envisioning in your mind. The two other villages, Corniglia and Manarola we did not get to visit but hope to next time!

Although we were only there a short time, we spent the entire time eating. Really. We did nothing else but walk and eat and people watch. Originally I had made a 4 day itinerary for Cinque Terre so I'm going to go ahead and list some of the restaurants here even though we only got to a few of them.
