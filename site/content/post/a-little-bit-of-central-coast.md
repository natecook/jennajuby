Happy Earth Day ya'll! (that always sounds better in your head)

Here's a little blabber and a few photos from one of my personal favorite places on earth. Last weekend, Nate and I drove up to San Luis Obispo, a beach city just 4 hours north of Orange County. Nate went to college there and some of our friends still live in the city, so we get a lot of excuses to visit throughout the year. As a matter of fact, we went to SLO exactly a year ago this week. It's a perfect time of year to go because the afternoons are still a little cool, and wildflowers are blooming all over the hillsides. Actually, the photos in this post are from our trip to SLO a year ago (and a little bit from our pit stop in Santa Barbara on the drive home). I never got around to posting them, and I didn't even bring my camera on our trip there this last weekend, so I figured this was a great time to put them up!

Most of the people in our lives have either lived here, visited frequently, or already know all about this city that some (including Oprah) call "the happiest city in America". BUT, by the off chance that you haven't visited (AHEM, all my east coast people that ask what to see in CA!) and will be exploring the west coast soon, add San Luis Obispo to your list of places to adventure. Start every morning at [Scout Coffee](http://scoutcoffeeco.com/ "Scout Coffee"), have lunch at [Sally Loo's Wholesome Cafe](http://www.yelp.com/biz/sally-loos-wholesome-cafe-san-luis-obispo-2 "Sally Loos Wholesome Cafe"), and in between hike and beach to your hearts desire!

Big shout out to my husband for introducing me to this sweet city, all the cute cafe's inside of it, and obviously taking every photo in this post that I am in. He's the coolest.
