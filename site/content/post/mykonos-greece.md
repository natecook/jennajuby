  And now onto the last island of our trip, Mykonos! Mykonos was so different
  from Santorini and Milos, and I’m glad we got to experience such variety in
  the islands that we visited. If Santorini was your beautiful and popular older
  sister, and Milos was younger brother who sleeps on the beach and does hair
  modeling, then Mykonos is for SURE your rich ass uncle with a yacht.

And now onto the last island of the trip, Mykonos! Mykonos was so different from Santorini and Milos, and I’m glad we got to experience such a variety in the islands that we visited. If Santorini was your beautiful and popular older sister, and Milos was your younger brother who sleeps on the beach and does hair modeling, then Mykonos is for SURE your rich ass uncle with a yacht. Get my drift? This place was SNNNAAZZZYYY. It’s also a very accommodating island, meaning that yes it still feels like Greece, but it also wouldn’t be hard to find gluten free bread and an almond milk matcha in the morning. And speaking of food, Mykonos had some really really good food, some of the best of our whole trip! And in addition to being known for their amazing restaurants, Mykonos is also famous for it's beachside clubs and yacht-filled coastline. It's such a fun-packed place and we met our close friends, Lauren and Andrew, there which made it even more exciting that we got to explore with them! We four rented a house together, which I recommend doing if you don't stay at a resort. Renting is probably the most cost effective way to stay on the island, plus most houses come with a pool! So without further adieu...here are some recommendations on planning your trip to Mykonos!

**Things To Do**

* Explore downtown Mykonos, have a drink overlooking Little Venice on the water, window shop (and really shop), and eat all the gelato and crepes you can! It's such a cute area filled with alleyways that are overflowing with flowers and pops of color everywhere. It’s quintessential Greece and you can’t not love it!
* Spend the day at a beach club! A club can range from blaring music and people doing coke to like...lounging in really plush beach chairs while children run around you making sandcastles. We did a little mix of both (sans the coke, lol). One day we rented lounge chairs at Lia Beach, which was really relaxing and pretty affordable. The lounge chairs were comfy, the water was beautiful, and there was great beachside food and drinks. On the flip side, we also went to Scorpios for the day. This beach club was absolutely over the top and amazing. Everyone there looked like an instagram model, the food was mind-blowingly good, and the resort itself was so unique and beautiful. At one point Lauren and I ordered this giant warm chocolate chip cookie that came in a rod iron skillet and we sat there eating it while looking at the ocean...does life get any better? 
* Spend an afternoon at Spilia. This restaurant/hotel/club is stunning, you will never want to leave. We had a late lunch there full of fresh fish and white wine, looking right out to the ocean as the biggest yacht’s you’ve ever seen floated around. I can’t figure out if the food or the view was better! After lunch we noticed that some people were swimming in the cove nearby so we explored and saw they were cliff jumping into the water. The whole thing was so scenic and surreal that I felt like it could have been a scene out of Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants.  Imagine...Blake Lively happens upon this beautiful cove and to impress whatever hot boy was around, she throws her tanned body off the highest point and soars into the water like some beautiful exotic fish. I, however, was too afraid to go full on Blake in this scenario, but there are a couple photos below of Nate doing his best Blake.  ALL THAT TO SAY, you should really do all of this because it was super fun. ^^^^^
* Spend the day at wherever you're staying...because most likely it was really expensive and you gotta get all you can outta that baby! We rented a house with a pool and a great outdoor area where we spent most of our time. We played cards for hours, floated around the pool, and drank a lot of delicious wine. Mykonos is all about relaxation and consumption, baby. Lounge and eat and tan to your heart's desire!
