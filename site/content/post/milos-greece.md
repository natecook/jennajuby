  The amazing island of Milos was the second stop on our Greek Island tour.
  There are so so SO many islands to choose from, and other than Santorini, I
  wasn’t positive of what other ones I wanted to visit when we started planning.
  After doing a lot of research, I decided that Milos was on the top of our
  list.

The amazing island of Milos was the second stop on our Greek Island tour. There are so so SO many islands to choose from, and other than Santorini, I wasn’t positive of what other ones I wanted to visit when we started planning. After doing a lot of research, I decided that Milos was on the top of our list. I thought I would like it...I didn’t think that I would love it like I did. I loved Milos as much as Santorini, which is saying a lot. It’s much less touristy, which is welcomed after the crowds of our last island. It’s a much more relaxed place, a bit more untouched, if you will. A lot of the locals don’t speak english, and google maps cannot be trusted there, haha. It was a perfect change from Santorini, especially because Milos is famous for it’s beaches, and the beaches in Santorini aren’t much to write home about. I wanted us to have a few relaxing days on some Grecian beaches and Milos was the perfect place for it. This island is filled with the bluest water I have ever seen, and the world’s most pristine beaches. The sea water is calm and crystal clear and shallow and everything you have ever wanted.  We spent our days there just exploring different parts of the island and again, eating our way through every town. If you are planning a trip to the Greek Islands, Milos should absolutely not be missed!

**Where To Stay**

_Pollonia_

The three biggest towns in Milos are Adamas, Pollonia, and Plaka. We ended up picking Pollonia because it’s the quietest of all three while still offering lots place to stay and eat. Milos is a very small island, and we rented a car, so getting around was very quick and easy! I wouldn’t say where you stay on the island is super important if you have a car to get around with.  Instead, just look for accommodations that look the best to you in any of the towns!

[Kapetan Tasos Suites](http://kapetantasos.gr/suites/?page_id=460)

We stayed at Kapetan and really really loved it. The suites were incredibly clean, beautiful, and modern but still had that Greecian charm.  The first morning we were there we ordered room service for breakfast and it was so delicious, we ended up ordering it all 3 mornings we stay with them!

**Things To Do**

* [Firiplaka Beach](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Firiplaka+Beach/@36.6647119,24.4664425,15z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x149920fd58f8f497:0x6055e73995079901!2sFiriplaka+Beach!8m2!3d36.6657089!4d24.4657953!3m4!1s0x149920fd58f8f497:0x6055e73995079901!8m2!3d36.6657089!4d24.4657953) day. All the lists I read about the top things to do in Milos, mentioned Firiplaka. At first I was a little confused by this because the photos I saw of it weren’t that great. We decided to do a beach day there anyway and when we got there I was stunned. It was the most beautiful water I’ve ever seen. The beach is only 3 feet deep for what seemed like a mile. There were no waves, the water was clear and warm. It was a dream! The beach is “organized” meaning they have day beds to rent and a place to get food and drinks. There was a little bar on the beach where we got cocktails and a yummy greek lunch. This was one of my favorite things we did in Milos, the absolute ideal beach day, the kind you dream up. Don’t miss a beach day here!
* [Volcano Boat Cruise](http://volcanoboat.eu/). We did another boat cruise in Milos, like the one in Santorini. I highly recommend doing this in Milos because some of the best beaches on the island are only accessible by boat! This cruise was more of an excursion rather than a boogie yacht-like cruise like we did in Santorini. Plan on spending the day jumping in and out of the boat, exploring remote beaches, and snorkeling in the clearest water you’ve ever seen! 
* Explore [Sarakiniko](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sarak%C3%ADniko/@36.7415649,24.4198447,15.02z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x149920ab9f323f3b:0x7846dcf6ac34c198!2sMilos!3b1!8m2!3d36.6914464!4d24.3935655!3m4!1s0x1498e099a99968d1:0x5d7b410fc19e9c1a!8m2!3d36.7427272!4d24.4582915). This is a beach but think of it more as a...land formation? It’s a beach with these incredible rock formations shaped by the high winds in Milos and it honestly looks like you’re walking on the moon. It’s such a unique place and you cannot go to Milos without seeing it. We went at sunset and it was a really pretty time of day to explore around the rock!
* Walk around the town of Plaka and see the Archeological Museum of Milos, get a snack at [Archontoula](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Archontoula/@36.7439182,24.4197723,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x1498d8ce60d4e34f:0xdc8456854647132!8m2!3d36.7439182!4d24.421961), something sweet at [Palaios Bakery](https://www.google.com/maps/place/PALAIOS+COFFEE+%26+PASTRY/@36.7439182,24.4197723,17z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x1498d8ce60d4e34f:0xdc8456854647132!2sArchontoula!8m2!3d36.7439182!4d24.421961!3m4!1s0x0:0x54cf8b8d1a193397!8m2!3d36.7441501!4d24.4218054), and have a sunset drink at Utopia Cafe overlooking the water. 
* See the colorful seaside town of [Klima](https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/262348619/klima/) and grab a drink of lunch at Astakas, right on the water. 
* Drive to [Firopotomas Beach](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Firopotamos+Beach/@36.7578094,24.425125,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x1498d92b1de0b2bb:0x7329821b0f9cc6a8!8m2!3d36.7578094!4d24.4273137), take a dip, see Agios Nikolaos church, or just stop to take a few photos of the beautiful water and charming bay.
