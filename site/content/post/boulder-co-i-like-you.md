Last weekend Nate surprised me with a getaway trip to Colorado with some of our closest friends, Gerrit and Afton! Last year Afton and I planned a surprise weekend for G and Nate, so I'm hoping this becomes a nice little cycle for us four. Originally being from Ohio, I am SO not use to mountains, especially snow caped ones. And having lived in Orange County the last 2 years, I sort of forget what "green" and "rain" mean. But Colorado ended up being a perfect combination of both California and Ohio. So perfect, right!? Two of my favorite places mushed together with some of my favorite people. Actually, if you moved the pacific ocean next to Boulder, and forced my family into a mountain house there, I would move there in a second. So, the trip started out with the Avett Brothers concert at [Red Rocks](http://redrocksonline.com/ "Red Rocks") (How did I just learn of this venue?) and dinner at [Silvis Kitchen](http://www.silviskitchen.com/ "Silvis Kitchen"). Gluten free lovers, this place rocked our world. Really. I've thought about our meal there at least 4 times since we ate it. They cooked caramelized onion INTO their burger meat. Sigh. They solely have turned me into a hamburger snob. Saturday started with the farmers market, where Afton and I discovered [Outrageous Baking](http://www.outrageousbaking.com/ "Outrageous Baking"), a gluten free baking company that even the boys approved of. We spent the rest of the afternoon hiking, which is what all my photos are from below. Found [Boxcar Coffee](http://www.boxcarcoffeeroasters.com/ "Boxcar Coffee"), and then grabbed dinner at [Centro](http://www.centrolatinkitchen.com/ "Centro") (the tacos...were..to...die for), and drinks at [License 1](http://license1boulderado.com/ "License 1") (a "speak easy" bar the really did used to be...a speak easy). I usually don't make a point to tell you every calorie I had while traveling, but Boulder blew me away with good food. And props to my husband for finding all of these awesome places without any help from me. Which by the way, I so generously offered 1,000 times throughout the weekend (food is not an easy thing for me to give up control over, people). He did SO good. We ended our trip with one of the best brunches of my life (duh) at [Snooze](http://snoozeeatery.com/ "Snooze"). If you know me (or Afton), we take brunch VERY seriously. Seriously enough I ordered two meals. One of them was a gluten free cinnamon roll pancake with white chocolate chip in the mix. I just...I can't even. I will never forget you, pancake. The hours following were pretty uncomfortable. Annnyway, I discovered there's a Snooze in California, only a short 90 minute drive away. Which we are now bound to make once a month.
