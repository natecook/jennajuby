I am about three years behind on putting up photos from our trips because I had a baby and apparently this is a very time consuming life change. Now that that baby is nearly graduating college, I have some time to upload these photos! First up is Newport Rhode Island, one of our first trips with just the three of us. 

Newport is about a three hour drive from Manhattan and a very popular beach destination on the east coast.  I can't believe this was only our first time with how close it is. It's a darling coastal town with all the sailboat, lobster roll, and New England vibes you have ever wanted. We went for a long weekend and below I'll list my favorite activities and restaurants that we enjoyed during our time there.

**Eats & Treats**

Coffee: [The Nitro Bar](https://goo.gl/maps/4Hd34gYHaKG1Eh9v5), [Drift Cafe](https://goo.gl/maps/ZcLyL1Pk3gHfo1rv6)

Breakfast: [CRU Cafe](https://goo.gl/maps/hHTWMbJd5j9Koz8E7), [Root](https://goo.gl/maps/sCbox8542dJ84DE38), [Kaffeology](https://goo.gl/maps/FRoayaisbVUpz3Qw5), [Corner Cafe](https://goo.gl/maps/sGbDqBDzTtmnPv1y5)

Drinks: [The Garden at The Vanderbilt](https://aubergeresorts.com/vanderbilt/dine/), [outdoor bar at Castle Hill Inn](https://www.castlehillinn.com/dine/), [Forty 1 Degrees North](https://goo.gl/maps/uR5FRMr3ig5JW5YY6), [Top of Newport Bar + Kitchen](https://goo.gl/maps/EpR6mQPG4A6T1Cf3A)

Lobster Rolls: [Knot Norms](https://goo.gl/maps/FKB4wB54K19hGgtd9), [Anthony's Seafood](https://goo.gl/maps/bQvk8xzzWv83tMZ38), [The Lobster Bar](https://goo.gl/maps/bJAFcSXTHKSrwm2k9), [The Newport Lobster Shack](https://goo.gl/maps/vXG54EgvUTgNXvVT7), [Flo's Clam Shack](https://goo.gl/maps/nzcbFkubS89Y9HNP9)

**Activities**

* The famous [Cliff Walk](https://www.discovernewport.org/things-to-do/cliff-walk/) should be at the top of everyone's list when visiting! It is a hike/walk along the coast that has beautiful views of the shoreline and close up looks at some of the Gilded Age mansions that Newport is well known for.
* Spend time at [Castle Hill Inn](https://goo.gl/maps/Zcbe4wER1eAWYZvW7). This is an activity worth your whole afternoon. First get a drink at their outdoor bar and grab a seat in their famous adirondack chairs (first come first serve) and watch the boats go by. Make sure while your'e there to take a short walk down to the Castle Hill Lighthouse. And last but not least, make sure to make a reservation at "The Lawn at Castle Inn" for your sunset dinner. You can easily spend a few hours here, it's so relaxing and the views are unbeatable!
* If you're visiting in the summer you have to do a beach day at one of Newport's many beaches. We enjoyed [Gooseberry Beach](https://goo.gl/maps/bmDJXP77eYD1Lb5p8) because it's great if you have young kids since it's a bay with small waves and shallow warm water. But [First](https://goo.gl/maps/komGLyZhkgXZjLU17) (Easton), [Second](https://goo.gl/maps/nCLtH2pLY1atavL57) (Sachuest), and [Third Beach](https://goo.gl/maps/x8AmZS5paKuHLb4Z7) are all great- just make sure to get there very early to avoid the crowds and get a parking spot or you may be turned away (it happened to us!). Also be aware of the "red tide", google it to plan accordingly. 
* [Bowen's Wharf](https://goo.gl/maps/tuKvTJoNvZspHk1Q9) in town is a must see, it looks like a wharf out of a storybook and has lots of yummy restaurants along the water popular for their clam chowder and lobster rolls.
* Newport is well known for their [Gilded Age mansions](https://www.newportmansions.org/live-the-drama/?gclid=CjwKCAiAl9efBhAkEiwA4Torik5yGeUL7rtHn_SzJoNHYpgxzHj1F41anMNw1CyDtNKBB7Ha_dKxjRoCZtcQAvD_BwE), they are spectacular and it wouldn't be a trip to Newport without seeing at least one of them. We saw "The Breakers" (summer home of the Vanderbilts) which is the most visited but seeing Marble House (another Vanderbilt summer home) The Elms, and/or Rosecliff (from the Great Gatsby) should be just as high on your list!
* Would it be a trip to New England without getting on a boat at least once? Book a [harbor tour](https://www.discovernewport.org/things-to-do/tours/harbor-tours/#listings) on a charter, yacht, or sailboat to see the coast, have a drink, and spot some ocean life!
