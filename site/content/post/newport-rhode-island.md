  I am about three years behind on putting up photos from our trips because I
  had a baby and apparently this is a very time consuming event. Now that that
  baby is nearly graduating college, I have some time to upload these photos!
  First up is Newport Rhode Island, one of our first trips with just the three
  of us. 


  Newport is about a three hour drive from Manhattan and a very popular beach
  destination on the east coast, I can't believe this was our first time! It's a
  darling coastal town with all the sail boat, lobster roll, and New England
  vibes you have ever wanted. We went for a long weekend and below I'll list my
  favorite activities and restaurants that we enjoyed during our time there.
