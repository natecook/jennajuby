  Last August Nate and I set off on our two week trip to Italy! I had only been
  to Milan previously and was anxious to see as much of the country this time as
  we could squeeze into a few weeks.

        Our favorite gelato in Rome was from Gelateria del Teatro in the Ponte

Last August Nate and I set off on our two week trip to Italy! I had only been to Milan previously and was anxious to see as much of the country this time as we could squeeze into a few weeks. It was really hard to pin down what cities we would visit during our trip, and I tend to favor quality over quantity and rather stay in places longer, than fit another place into our list. We finally landed on Rome, Florence, the Amalfi Coast, and Cinque Terre and would stay 3-4 days in each spot. I wanted to see the metropolitan cities but also get a taste of the coast and this seemed like a good mix. As it turns out, the time we were supposed to spend in Cinque Terre was terrible weather so we ended up cancelling our stay there and heading to Tuscany instead where the weather was sunny.  We did end up doing a day trip to Cinque Terre on an afternoon that was nice out but overall we ended up going from Rome, to Amalfi Coast, back up to Florence, and then ended our time in Tuscany with a day in Cinque Terre as well.

Rome. What a place. People have SO many opinions about Rome as it turns out. I had people tell me it was their favorite place in Italy and otherâs tell me to leave it out of our itinerary completely. Nate had been before and felt a little indifferent to it going in, he had a good time but also felt like it was a one and done sort of place. I decided to be optimistic and assume I would like it and we booked 3 days exploring Rome. I always say that so much of your impression of a place is dependent on your specific experience there and what you make out of it. For instance, if you have terrible weather and you got ripped off by the taxi at the airport, picked the wrong hotel, or spent too much time in a gross touristy spot...it doesnât really matter how great that place is in reality, you arenât going to like it. I have learned this 10 times over living in new york as well. People come to the city for 2 days, get lost on the subway for an hour, stand in the middle of the sidewalk to take photos and get yelled at and assume all 8.6 million new yorkers are not âmeanâ, didnât do any research on food and end up eating a crappy piece of pizza in times square and standing in a long line of sweaty tourists to see the Statue of Liberty when they could have gotten tickets ahead of time...yeah no shit you donât like New York, you did it all wrong! To really enjoy a new place, I think you need to plan well, get tickets to activities in advance, make dinner reservations at recommended spots, see some highlights but mostly spend your time in non-touristy areas, and go during the best season (and not in the dead of winter or height of summer). It seems like common sense but you would be shocked at how often people just make the wrong decisions, donât plan well, and then blame the place like itâs itâs own fault that your feet were tired all day. 

This is precisely how I felt about Rome, I see how people would be overwhelmed by it if they didnât do it right but MAN we had the best time. Our three days there were my favorite of our whole trip and I cannot wait to go back and do it all over again. We got tickets in advance to everything and waited in no lines, we made dinner reservations every night we were there at the yummiest places with the cutest outdoor seating, and honestly just soaked up every part of Rome. I absolutely adored it. It had the same energy as NYC and Paris and I loved being in the center of it all. Walking down cobblestone streets with gelato, people watching in the piazzaâs, sipping wine and eating pasta as the sun goes down- is there anything better?? Iâll stop here because I think anyone reading this will get the point. Rome is wonderful and below I will list the best places that we ate along with all of the fun activities we did while in the eternal city. 

All of the dinner and aperitivo places listed below have outdoor seating which I highly recommend. I couldnât even tell you what the inside of any of these restaurants looked like, I picked them based on their menu/reviews and cuteness level of their outdoor dining. I also made reservations ahead of time and requested an outdoor table...sometimes even a specific table that I could see in photos when researching the restaurant. This sounds crazy but you would be shocked how common it is for people to request this, especially if thereâs a particular table with the best view, just saying, itâs worth it!

Activities

Tour of the Colosseum and Roman Forum. We booked a tour guide to take us through both historical spots and it was some of the best money we spent! If we hadnât booked the tour, we would have had no idea what we were looking at and it honestly wouldnât have been that interesting. We booked this tour with âname of tour companyâ and I picked a small group (6 people or less so you didnât need to carry around headsets) for a more personal experience. It was so chill and our tour guide was wonderful, nothing felt rushed and it felt like we had a personal tour guide.

Spend an evening in Trastevere. This neighborhood is the evening hot spot in Rome with the most popular restaurants and bars. Itâs lively and beautiful and the vibe is so fun. We got aperol spritzes and watched the neighborhood come to life before dinner, this is a place you canât miss while in Rome!

Visit Borghese Gallery & Museum. This museum is nice because itâs very small but packed full of gorgeous sculptures and ceilings. You could easily only spend an hour inside and see the whole thing, which is a nice break from the bigger museums in Italy that can seem daunting. 

Spend an afternoon in Villa Borghese. The Villa Borghese, is a âgardenâ but more like Romeâs version of Central Park. Itâs named after the museum I just mentioned which resides inside of the garden itself. The villa is huge and you could spend a whole afternoon just walking around seeing the sights, stopping for lunch at one of the many cute cafeâs, or grabbing a gelato as you stroll around.

See St. Peterâs Square and St. Peterâs Basilica. Vatican City is so grand and unique and obviously a must do while in Rome. Seeing the square and going into the church could be, but doesnât have to be, time consuming. St. Peterâs Basilica has free entry but we spent about $10 to buy a "skip the line ticket" online before hand and passed hundreds of people to walk right in.

Visit the Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel. This is another place with a 3 hour line just to get tickets if you donât book them ahead of time. We got our tickets online weeks before our trip and again, walked right in with no wait. âSkip the lineâ tickets are pretty much sold for every big tourist sight in Rome and worth the $ a million times over.

Walk around and explore the Ponte neighborhood and Piazza Navona. This is the area of Rome that you picture in your head. Itâs picturesque and perfect. There are little cobblestone alley ways that open up to the beautiful Piazza Navona, and adorable gelato shops at every corner.  It is exactly what you dreamed of Rome to be.  

See the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps. I'll be straight with you, the fountain in stunning and you must see it, but there will be 1 million tourists there and it will not be a calm experience, haha. I have heard if you go first thing in the morning that it is way less crowded, so if you want a more peaceful experience head out there early! We were there at sunset, which gave beautiful light, but crowds as well. The Spanish Steps, which are near by, are also beautiful and a must see. Fun fact: you cannot sit on the spanish steps anymore, google it. We watched the sunset from the top of the steps though and it was really romantic!

See the Pantheon and go inside to see the amazing dome ceiling. This is free, quick, and easy and something you have to do because...itâs the pantheonâ¦in Rome!

Walk along the Tiber River with some gelato. The river runs right through the middle of the city and offers some beautiful views!
