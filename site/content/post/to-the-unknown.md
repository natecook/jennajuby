i was driving home from the Gypsy Den tonight and it dawned on me. i LIVE here. i wake up, go to work, leave for school, come home, do homework, laugh with my roomies, read a book, give nate a goodnight phone call, fall asleep. repeat the next day in some sort of order. but rarely do i stop and really let it sink in. i live here.

but as i was driving home one of my favorite worship songs came on the radio, "One Thing Remains". whenever i hear that song it brings back this warm feeling to my soul. it was the song that was playing when i visited Rock Harbor last year and i heard God speak to me so clearly. i was just visiting Rock Harbor at the time, knowing it would potentially be my church if i moved here. it was the first time I had ever heard the song. we sang the chorus over and over again, "your love never fails, never gives up, never runs out on me..." over and over again. it was like with every word God was pressing those words on my heart until i really believed it. i could go on forever about my experience that day. but what i came away knowing was that this was the beginning of God making me new and that He was going use that very room I was singing in to bring me back to Him. i can get so caught up in my new life in california that i don't stop and remember what brought me here in the first place. God knew exactly where i would be on March 12, 2013. because 365 days ago i was sitting at the yogurt land on Chapman with a group of people i had just met. i didn't know a year later so many of them would mean the world to me. i was terrified and excited and so lost. lost in the best way possible. and i'm still so lost. but i know now that the little cutie i met in her authentic indonesian get up is now one of my dearest friends. and i cry about every other day that she is moving to Nepal.

and that silly kid who sat next to me a year ago eating frozen yogurt...well we just finished our 6 week premarital class.

and my potential roommate chelsea kim would feel more like my family than i could have ever imagined.

so here's to 365 days ago. to the unknown. to God's faithfulness stamped all over my life. i don't want to forget because i'm comfortable. i want to be overwhelmed with thankfulness because He knows my flaws, my doubt, my sin, but "his love never fails, never gives up, never runs out on me".
