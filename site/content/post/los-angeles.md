I'm a firm believer in living it up where you are. I know, I know, I live in Southern California. But I have not always lived in the land of beaches and entertainment. And I've visited a lot of places that aren't considered destinations, by any means. But I think everywhere you go or live has it's own personality and whether it's "cool" or mundane, explore it regardless. In Orange County and LA, there are endless things to do. But people have lives, and while there's tourists everywhere actually using of all the groupons and travel zoo deals...there's also us. The people that have normal jobs and responsibilities that frankly just want to fall asleep watching Parenthood on a Friday night rather than go ride the ferris wheel at the Irvine Spectrum or something. Which, Nate and I are totally guilty of as well. Netflix is our best friend through most the work week, let's be honest. On this particular occasion we went to the Griffith Observatory. And bonus: it's completely free. Well, it's free if you hike (which we did). And, I may add, hiking is much more fun than just driving to the observatory. You get sweet views of the city and some nice weekend exercise. Never mind the mobs of people and dense smog, this is LA people! What do you expect! Deal with it and have fun anyway. Ok, there's my two cents. Force yourself to have fun and take advantage of the even remotely exciting things around you. Oh, and take lots of pictures. ![Travel photography, LA photography, LA tourism, griffith observatory](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ladaytrip_blog-14.jpg?w=560) ![Travel photography, LA photography, LA tourism, griffith observatory](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ladaytrip_blog-11.jpg?w=560) ![Travel photography, LA photography, LA tourism, griffith observatory](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ladaytrip_blog-16.jpg?w=560) ![Travel photography, LA photography, LA tourism, griffith observatory](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ladaytrip_blog-17.jpg) ![Travel photography, LA photography, LA tourism, griffith observatory](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ladaytrip_blog-13.jpg?w=560) ![Travel photography, LA photography, LA tourism, griffith observatory](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ladaytrip_blog-19.jpg?w=560) ![Travel photography, LA photography, LA tourism, griffith observatory](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ladaytrip_blog-10.jpg?w=560) ![Travel photography, LA photography, LA tourism, griffith observatory](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ladaytrip_blog-15.jpg?w=560) ![Travel photography, LA photography, LA tourism, griffith observatory](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ladaytrip_blog-12.jpg?w=560)
