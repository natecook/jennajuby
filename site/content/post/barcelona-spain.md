After our week in Mallorca, we flew to Barcelona to spend three days exploring the city.  Barcelona was so vibrant, colorful, and fun- we loved it! The food surpassed our expectations and it was a pretty easy city to navigate even with a two year old and stroller in tow. And with Barcelona being on the water, the beach vibe made the city feel like the perfect summer destination, I would not pass it up if you are planning a trip around Spain!

We stayed in the gothic quarter of the city at Hotel Neri and really liked the location.  It was pretty central to everything we wanted to see while in Barcelona and the hotel has a “casa” side which offers rooms that are more like apartments that have a living area and full kitchen as well. I highly recommend Hotel Neri and with that said, here is my list of recommendations on what to do and where to eat while visiting Barcelona!

**Activities**

* Explore some of Gaudi’s most famous works of architecture around the city…Sagrada Familia, Casa Batlló, Casa Mila, Park Guell, Casa Vicens and many more. These were the places of his we visited and were truly the gem of Barcelona. No trip is complete without seeing these gorgeous works of art!
* Walk down the lively La Rambla, a tree lined pedestrian street filled with shops, restaurants, musicians, and art.  La Rambla sits in the heart of the city and goes on for over a kilometer, and a must see when visiting Barcelona. Don’t forget to walk the wooden walkway of the Rambla De Mar, the continuation of La Rambla once it reaches the coast.
* Spend time in Ciutadella Park, there's so much to do and see, especially for kids!
* See the neighborhood of La Barceloneta and sunbath or have a seaside lunch on their famous beaches, Barceloneta Beach and Sant Sebastià Beach. 
* Wonder the cyprus maze of the beautiful Parc del Laberint d'Horta, a public garden outside the touristy area of the city and tucked away in the quiet Horta-Guinardó neighborhood.
* See my favorite part of any European city, the plazas…in Barcelona the Plaça Reial and Placa De Catalunya are the ones to see.
* Explore the gothic quarter of old town Barcelona, where you can step back in time and also see the Cathedral de Barcelona. This was also the neighborhood we stayed in a my preferenced place to walk around the city!

**Eats & Treats**

* **Right Side Coffee Bar,** for great coffee in the gothic quarter
* **Buenas Migas,** a good place with lots of locations in the city for coffee and quick breakfast
* **Kitchens of St. Catherine**, an open market with lots of different food offerings, open all day
* **Xup, Xup**, a seafood restaurant for a ocean side lunch right on the sand
* **Les Filles Cafe**, a beautiful place for lunch or dinner with yummy food and a pretty courtyard seating
* **Bistrot Levante**, a cute wine bar with great apps, sitting in a charming little plaza in the gothic quarter
* **Fismuler**, a fun trendy place to get dinner, reservations recommended 
* **Terrassa de Vivi**, beautiful rooftop bar with great views of the city

Also, here’s a list of spanish food, known in barcelona specifically, to try while you're in the region!

* bombas, pa am tomaquet, mato, fideua, escalivada, croquettes, cod fish, crema catalana, spanish omelette/tortilla, calcots, manchengo cheese, churros, and cava.
