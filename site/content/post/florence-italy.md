  Our third stop on our tour through Italy was Florence! We planned to only
  spend 3 days there but had a change of plans due to weather and ended up in
  Florence a few extra days.

Our third stop on our tour through Italy was Florence! We planned to only spend 3 days there but had a change of plans due to weather and ended up in Florence a few extra days. The city is a lot smaller than I imagined it, especially after coming from Rome, so it was easy to see a lot of it.  We ended up taking a day trip to the wine region of Chianti and another to the leaning tower of Pisa while we were there as well. In all we spent three days exploring Florence itself and it was such a beautiful city! It felt very relaxed and the architecture was beautiful to wander around and feast our eyes on. The city is full of so many pretty gardens and piazza’s, not to mention great food and museums. My favorite evening was our romantic dinner at Il Santo Bevitore with a walk along the Arno afterwards with gelato.  Speaking of gelato, some of the best we had was here in Florence, at Gelateria Edoardo, we went three times! I hope this list of places to eat, drink, be merry, and explore is helpful if you plan to visit Italy once travel is opened up again!
