Today is Nate and I's one year anniversary. In ways it feels like a life time ago, as if I can't believe there was a time when I wasn't married. And then part of me feels like it happened yesterday, and I just want it all to slow down and not rush by so quickly. I don't have anything earth shattering to say about marriage. Everything anyone has ever said about a union like ours is probably true in some way, and Nate and I are no exception. Being an extreme person myself, I joked with a good friend the other day that I can't remember many "neutral times" in the past 12 months. I feel like being married was either "THE BEST THING EVER!" or, "I can't live like this. The world has actually stopped spinning." This usually came after something horrible went down...like an "perfectly detailed dainty gold rimmed anthro wine glass has been shattered!". On an unrelated note, being married has made me realize I am more immature than previously thought. Ah, all in all, marriage is the bees knees. We've had more fun living life together than I could have imagined 365 days ago. And I know that some years will be better than others, and I'll still want to throw my shoe at him when he's chewing an apple too loudly- but he's worth it. And I think he still thinks I am too, regardless of me getting consistently weirder as time passes. Love you, Nate dogg. I love reliving our wedding day through these photos- you're the best human being a person could ever have the privilege to know. And even after a year, I am just as obsessed with you. Here are some highlights from our wedding day- we ADORE our wedding photos thanks to [Mason + Megan Photography](http://masonandmegan.com/)\- our friends and photographers. You captured our day perfectly. ![Cook-66](http://www.jennajuby.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cook-66.jpg) \[su\_row\] \[su\_column
