In the summer of 2021, we drove 8 hours from NYC to Acadia National Park in Maine to camp with a one year old baby. In hindsight this sounds like the worst idea but even to this day it is one of our favorite trips we've taken with Dean since he was born. Acadia is breathtaking and we had such a beautiful trip there together.

We stayed at Under Canvas, the same "glamping" company we stayed with in Zion National Park a few years ago (and Yellowstone this year). We loved our experience there and the camp ground at Acadia was perfect for kids. It was set right on a lake with a small rock beach that was a fun place for Dean to explore in the mornings and evenings when we weren't in the park. Under Canvas also sets up a smores stations every evening by the bonfire to have while listening to live music after dinner while looking at the stars. It's magical  experience to say the least and I highly recommend staying there if you visit Acadia.

Acadia National Park is a gorgeous 47,000 acres on the coast of Maine. It's a stunning mixture of mountain views, hiking trails along the coast and around their fresh water lakes. Most of the park is on Mount Desert Island and so is the town of Bar Harbor. Bar Harbor is such an adorable town and a must visit while you're in Acadia. Below I'll list the highlights of the park that we saw...keep in mind we did all the child friendly hikes and look outs so if you're looking for somethings more challenging, I would ask google for recs.
