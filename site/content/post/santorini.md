  Santorini was the first stop on our Grecian holiday.  Even though I had a list
  of dozens of things I wanted to do, the vibe of the island still seemed very
  relaxed and the best part was just walking around to different shops, gazing
  at the views of the Caldera, and of course eating every 20 minutes or so.

It really is a dreamy place, and yes it felt like Sisterhood of the Traveling pants in every single way and I would go back to Santorini over and over again. The charm of Santorini and Oia especially are what draws you in, and I hope that comes through in my photos. There’s no place like it. Here’s a list of all my travel recommendations for this beautiful greek island!

**Where to Stay**

**Oia**

this is easily the most famous village in Santorini and because of that, the most expensive. Even with it being pricey, I thought it was worth it because we would have spent the most time in Oia regardless of where we ended up staying on the island anyway. The views here are some of my favorite that I’ve ever seen and even though its crowded, it’s a perfect little village.

There are small hotels and resorts to stay in, but we decided to stay in an airbnb because I wanted to stay in one of the traditional cave houses. We stayed at “Evilio’s House” and it was one of the best parts of our trip. The listing has jaw dropping views and a patio that overlooks the small portion of the village that has a view of the sunset (you’ll see “Watch the sunset in Oia” on about every list of things to do in the Greek islands.) It was amazing to spend every evening there with a glass of wine. 

To Eat

Coffee: Coffee Island

Breakfast: Vitrin Cafe Creperie

Lunch: Pitogyros

Snack: Chillbox

Dinner: Pelekanos

Dessert: Lolita’s Gelato

Drinks: Santos Wines Winery

Also great…Katharos Lounge, Dimitris Ammoudi Taverna, Kastro Oja Restaurant, Kyprida, Galini Cafe, 

**To Do**

Boat Cruise. We took a half day boat cruise around the island with Santorini Gems. I did a LOT of research on what boat cruise to take because there are dozens of options. I picked this one because it had a smaller number of people allowed on each cruise (22 max) so the boat wasn’t crowded at all, and it felt much more personal and private (a lot of the other boats of the same size allow up to 50ish people).  It also had the half day option (5 hours cruise instead of 9 hours) which I liked because I didn’t want to spend the entire day on the boat since we didn’t have a ton of time in Santorini. It also got great reviews for the lunch that they bbq on board (the food was very very good). It was a litter pricier than the average cruise but worth it for the nice clean boat and accommodating staff. 

Explore the famous town of Oia (prounounced “ee-ah”). This is the quintessential Santorini town that you are picturing in your mind. It has the famous views of the cave homes and blue topped churches. It was my favorite place by far and I loved being there. Make sure to walk the entire length of the town to get all the Caldera views and shop along the way.

Take the Fire to Oia hike, it takes a couple of hours and the views are amazing. Plan to do this in the morning before it get too hot in the afternoon.

Get dinner or just drinks at Volkan on the Rocks Cafe and Cinema and view either Mamma Mia or My Big Fat Greek wedding which they play every night! The sunset before the movie is amazing from their balcony seating as well!

Visit Atlantis Books is Oia, it’s one of the most famous books stores in the world, and for good reason. It’s honestly incredible to walk around, even if you aren’t a reader. 

Amoudi Bay, not only should you have dinner down here (Dimitris Tavern was amazing but also one of the only places you could see the full sunset while you eat) but explore the bay. If you walk past all the restaurants you’ll come upon an area where you can cliff jump or just watch other brave souls do it. We walked around here before dinner and it was so pretty as the sun was going down.

Spend an afternoon at the wineries. The most well known one, and for good reason, is Santos Winery. The views are amazing, the wine was so so good, and we had so much fun just relaxing there for a few hours.
