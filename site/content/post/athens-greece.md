After our two week trip to Greece, like most places you take a holiday to, you learn a lot about traveling there. Leading up to the trip I did a lot of research and preparing, but nothing compares to experiencing a new place first hand. Some people don't like to plan a lot before their trip, leaving their time there for more spontaneity and such. I'm sure this works well for some personalities but I, on the other hand, LOVE planning, it's half the fun for me. Once the plane lands, I don't want to waste one second making last minute decisions on what to do or where to eat, I just want to enjoy it all and take it in. Plus, you'll inevitably have to spend time figuring out other things that you can't plan ahead for...like a train breaking down, a flight being cancelled, losing your luggage, or in my case, developing a strange rash every new place you visit (this is a fun game my body likes to play whenever we go on vacation). I figure that if I can't control these things, why not make the rest of the trip as easy as possible by having it planned out! With that said, I'm not obsessed with sticking to our plan for the day. If we wake up and feel like doing something totally different, or want to lay in bed for a few hours because we're tired- we do that! If we get to a restaurant and it's not what we expected, we peace out and wander around until we find something that looks good! My motto is to have a set plan for everyday and also be fine with doing absolutely none of it. I can't tell you the number of times we've had some fancy dinner reservation and end up cancelling it and eating tacos instead. Just go with whatever you feel!

With that said, here are my tips and tricks for planning your Greek Island holiday.

\- Spend at least a day in Athens. Everyone told me Athens wasn't great and that it wasn't worth our time so my expectations were low. But you most likely will fly into Athens on your way in our out (or both) of the islands anyway so why not spend a day there! We only had half a day but we seriously had a blast in Athens. It was so pretty and romantic and unexpected. We had a candle lit dinner on a stoop in between these beautiful old buildings while we watched the sunset. We sat around and drank wine for hours people watching and it felt more like Paris than Greece. The rooftops of every building were covered in flowers and hanging greenery and it was gorgeous. We ended the evening at a rooftop bar overlooking the Acropolis lit up at night. It was magical! I'll add a list of the places we went in Athens at the end of this post.

\- Rent a car on the islands. Having a car gave us the ultimate flexibility and freedom. I liked to explore the islands as much as possible and having a car made this easy. Some people stay at a resort and don't like to venture out much, so if this is what you decide to do, having a car wouldn't be as important. So many people on travel blogs disagree about needing a car but I was so happy we did. The other options are public transit, or renting an atv or scooter. Public transit seemed slow and unreliable and I didn't want to waste time waiting around for a bus or train when we could be exploring. ATV's scare the shit out of me, but if that's your thing, go for it! It's definitely cheaper. I would advise you not to google atv accidents in Greece before you do though, tourists die all the time on them because the roads are very narrow, windy, and pot hole ridden. I looked this up once we left because there was a couple who died in an ATV accident while we were in Santorini and it was so disturbing. Also you can't fit your luggage on an atv or scooter which makes getting to the airport or port pretty annoying. I think of an ATV or scooter as more of a one day activity to do while riding around the beach for fun. I also liked having a car because Greece is very dusty and I didn't want to be covered in dirt/dust and have my hair look insane every time we left for the day. With that said, renting a car isn't cheap, and sometimes parking was hard, but it was a great convenience to have that flexibility of a car! 

\- Visit in May, September, or October when it's still warm but not as busy. We didn't do this and went in August during the busy season and it was still amazing! But if I did it again I would go when the islands are a little less crowded.

\- Stay in an airbnb or rental home on at least one island! It's a fun way to get a feel for the Greek way of life and I was so happy we decided to do this.

\- Fly from island to island instead of taking the ferry. DISCLAIMER: I asked a lot of people about this and the jury is still out. When I researched before, everyone said to take a ferry. Then we took a fairy from Santorini from Milos and it was a nightmare. The
