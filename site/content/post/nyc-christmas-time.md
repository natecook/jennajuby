## Tips & Tricks

* Visit the city anytime after Thanksgiving (or during because the parade is so fun!) and a couple days after New Years to see all the holiday fun! The best times in my opinion are any of the 3 weekends leading up to Christmas in December. 
* Bring lots of layers. Sometimes it’s 55 and sunny in December and sometimes it’s 20 degrees and windy. Plan on wearing a proper winter coat, warm boots, gloves, the whole get up! You will be walking outside a good part of the day and you’ll be miserable if you’re not prepared for the cold. 
* A lot of the Christmas activities draw large crowds that can feel hectic so plan on going to the more popular sights in the morning, or if you can, on a weekday. 
* Leave 15 minutes earlier than you think for everything, the city comes to a crawl during this busy time of year.
* Make reservations at any and all places that will take them. Most of the places I listed will fill up for reservations the first day they are made available (which is usually 30 days out). 
* Get tickets to any show or viewing as early as you can, everything sells out fast!
