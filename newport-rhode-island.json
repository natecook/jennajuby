Now that that baby is nearly graduating college, I have some time to upload these photos! First up is Newport Rhode Island, one of our first trips with just the three of us. \n\nNewport is about a three hour drive from Manhattan and a very popular beach destination on the east coast, I can't believe this was our first time! It's a darling coastal town with all the sail boat, lobster roll, and New England vibes you have ever wanted. We went for a long weekend and below I'll list my favorite activities and restaurants that we enjoyed during our time there.
